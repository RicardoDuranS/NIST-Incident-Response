# NIST-Incident-Response

## Scenario

You are a cybersecurity analyst working for a multimedia company that provides web design, graphic design and social media marketing solutions for small businesses. Your organization recently experienced a DDoS attack, which compromised the internal network for two hours until it was resolved.

During the attack, your organization's network services suddenly stopped responding due to a flood of incoming ICMP packets. Normal internal network traffic was unable to access any network resources. The incident management team responded by blocking incoming ICMP packets, stopping all non-critical network services offline, and restoring critical network services. 

Next, the company's cybersecurity team investigated the security incident. They discovered that a malicious actor had sent a flood of ICMP pings to the company's network through an unconfigured firewall. This vulnerability allowed the malicious attacker to overwhelm the company's network through a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack.
